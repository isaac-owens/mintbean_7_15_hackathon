# Animation and Keyboard

For this Hackathon, our objetive was to make changes to a previously completed Hackathon project.  I decided to make the app a little more user friendly.

I added the notes being played to the keys themselves and also added some background music that can be played along to.  

Future Ideas:

- Make a music player out of the background music options
- Add a toggle button to toggle between keyboard keys and notes
- Add an adjustable metronome for practicing scales and pieces
